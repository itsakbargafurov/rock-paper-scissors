I created a 5 round game of rock, paper, scissors, which can be played from console to test some of JavaScript knowledge I gained with The Odin Project 'Foundations' course.

## Skills

I have mostly used functions and if-loops to play this game. In addition, I learnt how to use prompt, slice, and random methods in JavaScript.
